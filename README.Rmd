# ANTTV

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ANTTV provides methods for analysing data that represents textual variation in the New Testament. The New Testament, like all other works that have been through a hand-copying phase, exhibits textual variation. For instance, the apparatus of the 5th edition of the United Bible Societies *Greek New Testament* gives these readings and attestations at Mark 1.1:

1. Χριστου υιου θεου: Aleph-1, B, D, L, W
2. Χριστου υιου του θεου: A, Delta, fam-1, fam-13, 33, 180, ...
3. Χριστου υιου του κυριου: 1241
4. Χριστου: Aleph-*, Theta, 28-c, syr-pal, ...
5. omit: 28-*

Five different readings are listed. (Accents are omitted here.) The attestations follow colons on each line and identify the witnesses (i.e. manuscripts, lectionaries, versions, patristic citations) that support each reading.

A *data frame* (i.e. table) can be constructed with rows corresponding to witnesses and columns corresponding to variation sites such as the one just given. The cell addressed by a particular row and column contains a code representing the reading of that witness at that variation site. For example, if the numerals given in the above list of readings are used as codes, the value entered in the cell at the intersection of row *Theta* and column *Mark 1.1* would be *4*. Please note that the same codes (typically numerals) are reused at other variation sites; each variation site has its own correspondence between codes and readings; no association is implied by the same code being used at two different variation sites.

Analysis can begin with the data frame itself or with a *distance matrix* constructed by calculating distances between pairs of witnesses in the data frame. The analysis methods used in this package usually begin with a distance matrix calculated from a data frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ANTTV from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjfinney/ANTTV")
```

## Usage

A fairly common task when dealing with strings is the need to split a single string into many parts.
This is what `base::strsplit()` and `stringr::str_split()` do.

```{r}
(x <- "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta")
strsplit(x, split = ",")
stringr::str_split(x, pattern = ",")
```

Notice how the return value is a **list** of length one, where the first element holds the character vector of parts. Often the shape of this output is inconvenient, i.e. we want the un-listed version. That's exactly what `ANTTV::str_split_one()` does.

```{r}
library(ANTTV)

str_split_one(x, pattern = ",")
```

Use `str_split_one()` when the input is known to be a single string. For safety, it will error if its input has length greater than one. `str_split_one()` is built on `stringr::str_split()`, so you can use its `n` argument and stringr's general interface for describing the `pattern` to be matched.

```{r}
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",", n = 2)

y <- "192.168.0.1"
str_split_one(y, pattern = stringr::fixed("."))
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ANTTV)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
